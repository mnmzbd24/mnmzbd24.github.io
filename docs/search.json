    "text": "Crop damage from severe weather such as wind, rain, and flooding is projected to cause three billion dollars in crop damage annually by 2030. Accurately assessing these damages and understanding the genetic basis for why some cultivars survive while others do not is challenging, especially for flood damage where the fields may become inaccessible both during and after the flood event. Flooding events are also predicted to increase as climate change brings more extreme weather events. As Unoccupied Aerial Vehicle (UAV or Drone) resources become widespread, phenotyping from the sky has become an option to remove the bottlenecks, challenges, and safety risks of manually measuring flooding while still maintaining or increasing accuracy.\n\n\nIn my final Capstone presentation, I describe not only the utility of drones in an agricultural setting but also show the inferences that can be made from the images they collect. Using NDVI as a health indicator, the patterns of damage and recovery can be assessed across fields, years, and locations. The following figures show the vast differences between flooded and non-flooded Zea mays.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2020 represents a normal growing season while 2021 shows a field that underwent a natural flooding event at the V5 stage. The resulting analysis has shown that a closer look at environmental factors (soil, water, and management) need to be taken into account prior to specific cultivars being identified as flood-tolerant."

    "text": "BIPS (BioInformatics in Plant Science) has been working on our semester project. Currently, we are participating in Plant the Moon where student researchers from across the country come up with ideas to make regolith (moon substrate) viable for plant growth. \nDuring our preliminary meetings, we noticed that pure regolith did not absorb water. Instead, the water pooled on the top of the substrate. Our current idea to \"Plant the Moon\" is to increase the porosity of soil with perlite. This will increase water infiltration as well as nutrient absorption of the plants. We have done this by adding 10% more perlite per container up to 80%. Essentially creating a gradient of differing bulk densities. We will take images of these plants and characterize their growth patterns to identify the correlation between success and bulk density of the growing substrate. \n\n\n\n\n\nThe above image is of our current experimental design. Each container holds its designated amount of perlite and will be given the exact same water and nutrient treatments."

    "text": "Gridding the Reference Flight\n\nOpen QGIS and open a “New Project”\nGo to the “Layer” tab at the top, then “Add Raster Layer” - where it says browse, go to the Pix4D folder for the date and field being gridded and find the orthomosaic tiff file from your date of interest\nGo to Project -> Properties. Select CRS from the side tab. Change the Coordinate Reference System to “WGS 84/ UTM zone 15N” Authority ID: “EPSG:32615”\nSave project as Date_camera_field_QGIS\nWhen the orthomosaic shows up on the screen, go to the “Rotation” bar in the bottom right corner and change the rotation angle until the orthomosaic is straight (As straight as it can be, doesn’t have to be perfect)\n To create the origin point where the grid will start from:\n\nNavigate to the “Layer” tab at the top of toolbar then “Create Layer” then “New Shapefile Layer”\nSave with the name “origin” \nChange the project CRS to EPSG:32615-WGS 84/UTM zone 15N Click ok\n\nClick the “Toggle Editing” and then “Add Point Feature” (dot and three stars icon at top of page) - make the point in the lower left corner above the GCP in between the plants in the first experimental plot\n When the labeling window comes up, name the point “1”\n\n\n To get to the processing toolbox:\nGo to “Plugins” then “Manage and Install Plugins” \nRe-check the box for “Processing”\n\nClose the tab and click on the “Setting” icon that looks like a gear and the toolbox will appear\n\nClick on the “R” option and in the drop down menu click “Draw Plots from points” -  a window should appear with all of the options for inputting the range and row measurements. To create the grid:\n\n\n\nBased on information from the field map given, enter the number of ranges in the box for “Number of ranges per block” and enter the number of rows in the box for “Number of rows per block”\nIn the angle of rotation, enter the opposite (+/-) number of the rotation the orthomosaic is set at, which can be seen in the bottom right corner of the screen\nMake the measurement unit for plot size “feet” and the ID format “serpentine”\n\nStart the numbering plots should be “bottom left”\nThe “Full plot height” and “Data plot height” should be the length of each plot in feet and the “Full plot width” and “Data plot width” should be the width of each plot in feet\nSet the Field containing ID to “123 id” (a common error with the script happens when this setting isn’t correct)\n\n11. Go to the log tab at the top of the window to see if the script runs successfully\n12. When the script is finished running, the grid will generate on top of the orthomosaic with the boxes colored in. To make the boxes transparent:\n\nClick on the layer in the “Layers” Menu on the left side of the screen\nIn the dropdown menu, go to “Properties” then “Symbology” on the left side of the window\nChange the fill to the red outline\nClick on the “Simple Line” below “Fill” and change the line width to “Hairline” \nClick “Ok”\n\n13. Go through each row of the grid checking that each box contains one plot - the plots on the end of each row and range don’t need a box because they’re border - so when the grid is used for future flights the plots will, for the most part, already be lined up (This step will probably take the longest)\n14. Turn off toggle editing on the Trial grid layer\n15. Export the reference grid for future use (***THIS MUST HAPPEN EVEN IF THE GRID ISN’T FINISHED…YOU WILL DELETE EVERYTHING IF NOT DONE!!!!!!!!)\n\nSelect the grid (“All trials”) from the layers toolbar on the left\nRight click on the grid and go to Export -> Save Feature As…\nSelect the “GeoPackage” as the format\nSelect the “...” button and navigate to the main directory for this field (i.e., Gen7)\nName the file as “Reference_grid_[Field Name]_[Year]”. Click Save. Click Ok.\n\n\nHOW TO OPEN THE FILES AND START ALTERING THE GRID AGAIN AFTER INITIAL CLOSING AND SAVING\n\nOpen QGIS\nProject -> Open… -> select the project from the date of interest .qgz (this will only open the orthomosaic)\nLayer -> Add Layer -> Add Vector Layer\n\nChoose the Reference_grid_“field”_“date”\n\nEnable Toggle editing on the Reference grid layer\n\nRight click -> Properties -> symbology change the grid to red outline and change the line weight to hairline\n\nResume fixing the grid"

As part of my second course, I was able to create a conservation plan including cultural and traditional management techniques. I chose to focus on Rollins Farm in Columbia, Missouri since it is the location where the data was collected for my capstone project. The lower portion of the farm has a long history of flooding. Therefore, I chose to focus on decreasing the amount of nitrogen runoff and erosion. A full proposal of the plan and calculations can be seen below.\n\nProject Documentation"

    "text": "Throughout the semester I was able to learn about major categories of pathogens: fungi, nematodes, bacteria, and viruses. We focused on the visualization of structures specific to each type of pathogen, the identification process, and management strategies. I was able to learn about common pathogens and their disease triangles. This is a diagram that connects the pathogen to the environment and management practices, allowing for better control of the pathogen in agricultural settings.  \n\nimage source: https://www.popularmechanics.com/science/a32238447/disease-triangle-covid-19-coronavirus-flatten-curve/\nIn the lab section of the course, I had the opportunity to run an ELISA test, PCR, try innoculations, and get some more microscopy experience. In the image below, a tobacco plant inoculated with Tobacco Mosaic Virus tagged with a green fluorescent protein (TMV-GFP) can be seen. We were able to visualize the virus’s pattern of movement over the span of a week. \n\nWhen viruses first invade a plant they move towards the roots and other vascular structures. Then they make the ascent to the top of the plant to colonize young foliar tissues. This is why we can see the TMV-GFP fluorescing under UV light in the roots primarily and partially in the upper shoot of the plant.\n\n\n\nIn a separate lab, I was also able to run through the process of PCR. We used this test to determine whether or not our samples contained the Cauliflower Mosiac Virus. Then we were able to run gel electrophoresis to visualize the size of the bands present and make a determination on whether our samples were positive or negative for the virus. We can see in the image below that sample 4.1 was positive and 4.2 was negative. \n\n\nOverall, I enjoyed every moment in my Plant Pathology class and walked away with new skills and an awareness of how to prevent and manage plant pathogens."
