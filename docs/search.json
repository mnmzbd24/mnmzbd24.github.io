    "text": "Crop damage from severe weather such as wind, rain, and flooding is projected to cause three billion dollars in crop damage annually by 2030. Accurately assessing these damages and understanding the genetic basis for why some cultivars survive while others do not is challenging, especially for flood damage where the fields may become inaccessible both during and after the flood event. Flooding events are also predicted to increase as climate change brings more extreme weather events. As Unoccupied Aerial Vehicle (UAV or Drone) resources become widespread, phenotyping from the sky has become an option to remove the bottlenecks, challenges, and safety risks of manually measuring flooding while still maintaining or increasing accuracy.\n\n\nIn my final Capstone presentation, I describe not only the utility of drones in an agricultural setting but also show the inferences that can be made from the images they collect. Using NDVI as a health indicator, the patterns of damage and recovery can be assessed across fields, years, and locations. The following figures show the vast differences between flooded and non-flooded Zea mays.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2020 represents a normal growing season while 2021 shows a field that underwent a natural flooding event at the V5 stage. The resulting analysis has shown that a closer look at environmental factors (soil, water, and management) need to be taken into account prior to specific cultivars being identified as flood-tolerant."

    "text": "BIPS (BioInformatics in Plant Science) has been working on our semester project. Currently, we are participating in Plant the Moon where student researchers from across the country come up with ideas to make regolith (moon substrate) viable for plant growth. \nDuring our preliminary meetings, we noticed that pure regolith did not absorb water. Instead, the water pooled on the top of the substrate. Our current idea to \"Plant the Moon\" is to increase the porosity of soil with perlite. This will increase water infiltration as well as nutrient absorption of the plants. We have done this by adding 10% more perlite per container up to 80%. Essentially creating a gradient of differing bulk densities. We will take images of these plants and characterize their growth patterns to identify the correlation between success and bulk density of the growing substrate. \n\n\n\n\n\nThe above image is of our current experimental design. Each container holds its designated amount of perlite and will be given the exact same water and nutrient treatments."

    "text": "As part of my Plant Science education, I had the opportunity to take two Soils courses. The first was an introductory course that focused on how soils are formed, the classification of horizons and orders, and a hands-on lab section. In the image below I am bailing out water from a soil pit so that we can get an accurate look at the face of the soil to determine the types of horizons present.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe second was focused on nutrient management. As part of my second course, I was able to create a conservation plan including cultural and traditional management techniques. I chose to focus on Rollins Fram in Columbia, Missouri since it is the location where the data was collected for my capstone project. The lower portion of the farm has a long history of flooding. Therefore, I chose to focus on decreasing the amount of nitrogen runoff and erosion. A full proposal of the plan and calculations can be seen below."
