My goal streamline their use for others within the lab. For a more in depth tutorial the FIELDimageR tutorial from OpenDroneMap is what my work is based on.\n\nLINK: https://github.com/OpenDroneMap/FIELDimageR\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**Creating the File System:**\n\n1.  Create a folder titled \\\"Name of Field_Data_Extraction\\\"\n\n2.  Within this folder, there should be subfolders labeled \\\"Date of Imaging_DE\\\" (This folder will turn into the working directory for the script)\n\nThis folder will need to contain the following:\n\n-   A copy of the RGB .tif file\n\n-   A copy of the RGB dsm .tif file\n\n-   A copy of all Multispectral .tif files\n\n-   A copy of all the files in the originals folder \n\n    -   01_Phenotype_Extraction\n\n    -   02_Data_Cleaning\n\n    -   03_Phenotype_Graphs\n\n    -   6 Rollins5_grid_NEW files \n\n    -   Rollins_Field_Map_NEW.csv\n\n    -   210604_m2pro_Rollins5_Pix4D_dsm.tif\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**Running the 01_Phenotype_Extraction Script:**\n\n1.  Once the script is open the assigned variables will need to be changed in accordance with the new working directory and flight date\n\nVariable Naming System:\n\n-   wd = pathway to the working directory (\\\"Date of Imaging_DE\\\" folder)\n\n-   x = file name of the grid\n\n-   y = file name of the RGB tif\n\n-   z = name of the final indices values file (will be exported to wd)\n\n-   b = name of the final LAI values file (will be exported to wd)\n\n-   c = digital surface model of the DSM\n\n-   d = reference DEM with no plants\n\n-   e = the final file name of the plant height values\n\n2.  Click the green run triangle in the top right corner of each r chunk in the script...some steps will take a while to run\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**Running the 02_Data_Cleaning Script:**\n\n1.  Once the script is open the assigned variables will need to be changed in accordance with the new working directory and flight date\n\nVariable Naming System:\n\n-   wd = pathway to the working directory (\\\"Date of Imaging_DE\\\" folder)\n\n-   x = name of the final indices csv file\n\n-   y =  name of the final height values csv file\n\n-   z = name of the final LAI values csv file\n\n-   m = the name of the column and row csv file from planting \n\n-   a = the name of the new condensed file\n\n2.  Click the green run triangle in the top right corner of each r chunk in the script...some steps will take a while to run\n\n3.  After this step, I like to organize all the files in the folder\n\n    1.  Originals = all the files copies from the originals folder\n\n    2.  210701 or the date = all the tiffs from that specific date\n\n    3.  Height\n\n    4.  LAI\n\n    5.  Indices\n\n    6.  Leave the All_Data in the working directory folder\n\n\\\n"},"formats":{"html":{"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":true,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","css":["../../styles.css"],"toc":true,"output-file":"index.html"},"language":{},"metadata":{"lang":"en","fig-responsive":true,"quarto-version":"1.2.269","editor":"visual","theme":"minty","title-block-banner":true,"title":"Orthomosaic Phenotyping Through FIELDimageR","author":"Madison Mitchell","date":"2023-02-06","categories":["news","analysis","SOP"],"image":"image.png"},"extensions":{"book":{"multiFile":true}}}}}
