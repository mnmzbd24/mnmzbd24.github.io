The orthomosaic (when produced by agisoft) is a stacked version of these five bands that is adjusted so that we perceive it normally RGB/visible bands (when in Pix4D...no RE/NIR)![](Screen%20Shot%202024-04-08%20at%2011.46.49%20AM.png)\n-   Import all bands (.TIFF) for the date of interest from the Pix4D 04_indice-\\>reflectance folder\n-   Import the grid as a .geopkg\n-   Rename them as Red, Green, Blue, NIR, RE (do not mix them up during this process the indice values will end up being incorrect![](Screen%20Shot%202024-04-08%20at%2011.46.56%20AM.png)\n-   In order to calculate an indice in QGIS you will need to know the mathematical formula for the indice. A good resource for finding this is: https://www.nv5geospatialsoftware.com/docs/BroadbandGreenness.html\n-   For this example, we will be using NDVI and GSAVI (this site also provides the sources for the indices for easy citation in papers)\n-   In our images we have pixels, and each pixel has a value in each band\n-   In order to calculate the NDVI of the whole image we will use the raster calculator option in QGIS and type in the NDVI equation (NIR-Red)/(NIR+Red). (Make sure that you use the names of the bands with values that you are using and thee keypad on the screen)![](Screen%20Shot%202024-04-08%20at%2011.47.02%20AM.png)\n-   GSAVI = (1.5\\*(NIR-GREEN))/(NIR+GREEN+0.5)![](Screen%20Shot%202024-04-08%20at%2011.47.09%20AM.png)\n-   GSAVI \\> 0.2 = mask (figure out how to do the thresholding for soil removal process)\n-   NDVI\\*GSAVI = NDVI_V\n-   (NDVI_V\\*NDVI_V)/NDVI_V = final_NDVI\n-   The equation in red above allows for the soil to be considered N/A values...which we need in order to take plot means and medians (or other measures)\n    -   (0+0+0+0+0.8+0.7+0.8+0.7)/8 = 0.37\n\n    -   (N/A+N/A+N/A+N/A+0.8+0.7+0.8+0.7)/8 = 0.7\n\n![](Screen%20Shot%202024-04-08%20at%2011.47.17%20AM.png)\n"},"formats":{"html":{"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":true,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","css":["../../styles.css"],"toc":true,"output-file":"index.html"},"language":{},"metadata":{"lang":"en","fig-responsive":true,"quarto-version":"1.2.269","editor":"visual","theme":"minty","title-block-banner":true,"title":"Learning Multispectral Indice Extraction Through QGIS","author":"Madison Mitchell","date":"2024-04-08","categories":["SOP","code","analysis","education"],"image":"Picture1.png"},"extensions":{"book":{"multiFile":true}}}}}
