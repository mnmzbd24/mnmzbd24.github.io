The first was an introductory course that focused on how soils are formed, the classification of horizons and orders, and a hands-on lab section. In the image below I am bailing out water from a soil pit so that we can get an accurate look at the face of the soil to determine the types of horizons present.\n\n![](IMG_6640.jpeg){fig-align=\"center\" width=\"5in\"}\n\n\\\nThe second was focused on nutrient management. As part of my second course, I was able to create a conservation plan including cultural and traditional management techniques. I chose to focus on Rollins Farm in Columbia, Missouri since it is the location where the data was collected for my capstone project. The lower portion of the farm has a long history of flooding. Therefore, I chose to focus on decreasing the amount of nitrogen runoff and erosion. A full proposal of the plan and calculations can be seen below.\n\n"},"formats":{"html":{"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":true,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","css":["../../styles.css"],"toc":true,"output-file":"index.html"},"language":{},"metadata":{"lang":"en","fig-responsive":true,"quarto-version":"1.2.269","editor":"visual","theme":"minty","title-block-banner":true,"title":"Soils Experience","author":"Madison Mitchell","date":"2023-05-09","categories":["news","education"],"image":"IMG_6640.jpeg"},"extensions":{"book":{"multiFile":true}}}}}
