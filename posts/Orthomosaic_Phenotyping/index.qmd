This is SOP specific to the scripts I have created and stored in my Flood_Tolerance repository. My goal streamline their use for others within the lab. For a more in depth tutorial the FIELDimageR tutorial from OpenDroneMap is what my work is based on.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Creating the File System:**

1.  Create a folder titled \"Name of Field_Data_Extraction\"

2.  Within this folder, there should be subfolders labeled \"Date of Imaging_DE\" (This folder will turn into the working directory for the script)

This folder will need to contain the following:

-   A copy of the RGB .tif file

-   A copy of the RGB dsm .tif file

-   A copy of all Multispectral .tif files

-   A copy of all the files in the originals folder 

    -   01_Phenotype_Extraction

    -   02_Data_Cleaning

    -   03_Phenotype_Graphs

    -   6 Rollins5_grid_NEW files 

    -   Rollins_Field_Map_NEW.csv

    -   210604_m2pro_Rollins5_Pix4D_dsm.tif

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Running the 01_Phenotype_Extraction Script:**

1.  Once the script is open the assigned variables will need to be changed in accordance with the new working directory and flight date

Variable Naming System:

-   wd = pathway to the working directory (\"Date of Imaging_DE\" folder)

-   x = file name of the grid

-   y = file name of the RGB tif

-   z = name of the final indices values file (will be exported to wd)

-   b = name of the final LAI values file (will be exported to wd)

-   c = digital surface model of the DSM

-   d = reference DEM with no plants

-   e = the final file name of the plant height values

2.  Click the green run triangle in the top right corner of each r chunk in the script...some steps will take a while to run

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Running the 02_Data_Cleaning Script:**

1.  Once the script is open the assigned variables will need to be changed in accordance with the new working directory and flight date

Variable Naming System:

-   wd = pathway to the working directory (\"Date of Imaging_DE\" folder)

-   x = name of the final indices csv file

-   y =  name of the final height values csv file

-   z = name of the final LAI values csv file

-   m = the name of the column and row csv file from planting 

-   a = the name of the new condensed file

2.  Click the green run triangle in the top right corner of each r chunk in the script...some steps will take a while to run

3.  After this step, I like to organize all the files in the folder

    1.  Originals = all the files copies from the originals folder

    2.  210701 or the date = all the tiffs from that specific date

    3.  Height

    4.  LAI

    5.  Indices

    6.  Leave the All_Data in the working directory folder
