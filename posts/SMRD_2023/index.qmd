I always love an opportunity to discuss my most current research. In MIZZOU's Show Me Research Day Symposium I was able to present my findings and gain valuable insights from other scientists within our local community. As I look towards the future of my flood-tolerance work, I hope to be able to continue to share and collaborate with others. This was a great way to end my semester!
