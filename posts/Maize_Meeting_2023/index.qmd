I had a blast at the MGC Meeting! I had the opportunity to present my current research, attend numerous talks from experts in their fields, and network with amazing individuals. Along with members of the  Flint-Garcia Lab, we also took home a win in the trivia competition. Overall, a great first-ever conference to attend!
