Today was the first session of our Lab Lit Review Group. As a collective we were able to share our interpretations of the first piece of primary literature we read together this semester. We focused of the development of C4 photosynthetic anatomy in maize and facilitated positive environment for students of from various degree paths to ask and answer questions.

I am glad I had the opportunity to organize and lead the first session and I am excited to see what we learn and teach each other throughout the semester.
